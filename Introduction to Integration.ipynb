    "# Basic Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differentiation Reversed\n",
    "\n",
    "When $x^2$ is differentiated with respect to $x$, the derivative is $2x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, if the derivative of an unknown function is $2x$, then the unknown function could be $x^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process of finding a function from its derivative, which reverses the operation of differentiating, is called **integration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Constant of Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen above, $2x$ is the derivative of $x^2$, but it is also the derivative of $x^2 + 3$, $x^2 - 9$, and, in fact, the derivative of $x^2$ plus any constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the result of integrating $2x$, which is called the **integral** of $2x$, is not a unique function but is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ x^2 + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ is any constant. \n",
    "\n",
    "$K$ is called the **constant of integration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int 2x \\, dx = x^2 + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\int \\ldots \\, dx$ means the integral of $\\ldots$ with respect to $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating any function reverses the process of differentiating, so for any function $f(x)$ we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int \\frac{d}{dx} f(x) \\, dx = f(x) + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, because differentiating $x^3$ with respect to $x$ gives $3x^2$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int 3x^2 \\, dx = x^3 + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "and it follows that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3}x^3 + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is not necessary to write $\\frac{1}{3}K$ in the second form, as $K$ represents any constant in either expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the derivative of $x^{n+1}$ is $(n+1)x^n$, so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\int x^n \\, dx = \\frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate a power of $x$, increase the power by $1$ and divide by the new power.\n",
    "\n",
    "This rule can be used to integrate any power of $x$ except $-1$, which is considered later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrating a Function with a Constant Multiplier\n",
    "\n",
    "When integrating a function of the form $c x^n$, where $c$ is a constant, the constant can be factored out of the integral. This is because the integral of a constant multiplied by a function is equal to the constant multiplied by the integral of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example: Integrate $c x^n$\n",
    "1. **Integrate $c x^n$**:\n",
    "    $$ \\int c x^n \\, dx = c \\int x^n \\, dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the rule for integrating $x^n$:\n",
    "    $$ \\int x^n \\, dx = \\frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "    $$ \\int c x^n \\, dx = c \\left( \\frac{1}{n+1} x^{n+1} \\right) + K = \\frac{c}{n+1} x^{n+1} + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these rules, you can integrate polynomials and other functions of $x$ with a constant multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Integrate $x^3$**:\n",
    "    $$ \\int x^3 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3+1} x^{3+1} + K = \\frac{1}{4} x^4 + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate $5x^4$**:\n",
    "    $$ \\int 5x^4 \\, dx = 5 \\int x^4 \\, dx = 5 \\left( \\frac{1}{4+1} x^{4+1} \\right) + K = \\frac{5}{5} x^5 + K = x^5 + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integrate $7x^{-2}$**:\n",
    "    $$ \\int 7x^{-2} \\, dx = 7 \\int x^{-2} \\, dx = 7 \\left( \\frac{1}{-2+1} x^{-2+1} \\right) + K = 7 \\left( \\frac{1}{-1} x^{-1} \\right) + K = -7 x^{-1} + K = -\\frac{7}{x} + K $$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Integrate $4x^{1/2}$**:\n",
    "    $$ \\int 4x^{1/2} \\, dx = 4 \\int x^{1/2} \\, dx = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{1/2+1} x^{1/2+1} \\right) + K = 4 \\left( \\frac{1}{3/2} x^{3/2} \\right) + K = 4 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} x^{3/2} \\right) + K = \\frac{8}{3} x^{3/2} + K $$\n",

    "If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two functions, then the integral of their sum (or difference) is the sum (or difference) of their integrals. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n",
